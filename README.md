 A mobile application which delivers vehicle services to its users around the city. Users can rent any kind of vehicle (car, bike, truck, bus) through the application from their mobile phones. Both the vehicle renters and rentees are users of the software.
It is a revolutionized version of traditional rental businesses where diverse vehicle options are available, doesnâ€™t require you to personally go and look out for a vehicle, you can set the price range yourself with available delivery options to your doorstep.
